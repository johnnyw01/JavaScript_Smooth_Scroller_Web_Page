# JavaScript_Smooth_Scroller_Web_Page
This project contains two scripts, one provides a smooth scrolling effect, when you click the links.
The other will take effect when you manually scroll the page. This second script will highlight the correct nav element that is currently in view.
There are two versions of this project, one that uses vanilla JavaScript and one that uses jQuery.
